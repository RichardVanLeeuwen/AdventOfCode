I did a couple puzzles last year, and got reminded that AoC is going on this year again.
I'm interested in learning rust, but never did. So this is to learning.

*Credits:
Setup taken from [Chris Biscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code), but completely stripped down to just the parts I need.

*Help:
To generate empty template for a fresh day* : `cargo generate --path ./daily_template --name day-01`
To test: `cargo test -p day-03 part1`
To run: `cargo run -p day-01 --bin part1` 
* Install cargo-generate to enable generation.

*Confessions:
Day-01: Mostly 'stolen' from Chris, mostly due to not knowing any rust or how to get started.
Day-02: Mostly 'stolen' from Chris, same reason, did however remove his solution for ascending/descending checking and used my own mathmatical based solution.
Day-03: Completely self written! I should improve the solutions by better applying capture groups to extract the numbers from the `mul(x,x)` statements.
Day-04:
